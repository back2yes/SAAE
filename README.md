# Semantic Adversarial Autoencoder

Python code (using TensorFlow) of Semantic Adversarial Autoencoder (SAAE), including using explicit matching and implicit matching. Also include the implementation of Semantic Autoencoder (SAE, arXiv:1704.08345), and its variation with GAN.

## Getting Started

In the code directory, run_*.py are the run script for training and evaluating the four models. To run one of the model, after setting up the environment, type, for example,

```
python run_aaeexp_AwA_sZSL.py
```
